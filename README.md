## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
This analysis ran a linear regression model on the car's factors including:
- Vehicle Length
- Vehicle Weight
- Spoiler Angle
- Ground Clearance
- AWD

to determine the affect on miles per gallon (MPG).

<<<<<<< HEAD
The factors that have the most impact on MPG are Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance.  This is based on the PR(>|t|) value in the summary table above.

The p-value of 5.35e-11 is well below the significance level of 0.05% whic means the slope is not zero.

This model would be considered effective at predicting MPG because the R-Squared value is 0.7149 mean that the model is successful 71% of the time.
